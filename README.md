# PyBham
Contains lots of useful scripts and resources for the NA62 experiment at CERN mostly Python based. 

## Setup
First clone the repository to LXPLUS or your local machine then run the setup.sh script. This will install miniconda3 and create a virtual Python environment called "na62". We recommend using Python virtual environments to avoid package conflicts.
